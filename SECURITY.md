# Security policy
This document outlines the security protocols and vulnerability reporting guidelines for the Plane project. Ensuring the security of our systems is a top priority, and while we work diligently to maintain robust protection, vulnerabilities may still occur. We highly value the community’s role in identifying and reporting security concerns to uphold the integrity of our systems and safeguard our users.

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you have identified a security vulnerability, submit your findings to [security@plane.so](mailto:security@plane.so). 
Ensure your report includes all relevant information needed for us to reproduce and assess the issue. Include the IP address or URL of the affected system.

To ensure a responsible and effective disclosure process, please adhere to the following:

- Maintain confidentiality and refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have had the opportunity to investigate and address the issue.
- Refrain from running automated vulnerability scans on our infrastructure or dashboard without prior consent. Contact us to set up a sandbox environment if necessary.
- Do not exploit any discovered vulnerabilities for malicious purposes, such as accessing or altering user data.
- Do not engage in physical security attacks, social engineering, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, spam campaigns, or attacks on third-party applications as part of your vulnerability testing.

## Out of scope
While we appreciate all efforts to assist in improving our security, please note that the following types of vulnerabilities are considered out of scope:

- Vulnerabilities requiring man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks or physical access to a user’s device.
- Content spoofing or text injection issues without a clear attack vector or the ability to modify HTML/CSS.
- Issues related to email spoofing.
- Missing DNSSEC, CAA, or CSP headers.
- Absence of secure or HTTP-only flags on non-sensitive cookies.

## Our commitment

With your permission, we are happy to publicly acknowledge your contribution to improving our security once the issue is resolved.
